<h3>Hotel Rating System Project by using Microservices Architechture</h3>
<br>
<p> In this project I have developed a Hotel Rating System in which the User(client) can get information about different hotels. User see the feedbacks given by other users for any hotel and can also give his/her feedback. I have used microservice architecture and have created all the services as microservice which are interacting with each other with the help of REST APIs
.</p>
<br>
<h4> Backend Working Process</h4><br>
<p>There are three main microservices in this system:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<li>User Service</li>
<li>Rating Service</li>
<li>Hotel Service</li>
</ul>
